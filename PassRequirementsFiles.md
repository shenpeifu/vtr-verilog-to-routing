# Pass Requirements Files #

## Overview ##
The provided scripts allow you to execute a task, and compare it to "golden" results generated by a previous task execution.  The comparison, which is performed when using the **`-check_golden`** option of the [parse\_vtr\_task.pl](ParseVTRTask.md) script, reports either 'Pass' or 'Fail'.  The requirements that must be met to qualify for a 'Pass' are specified in the Pass Requirements File.

## Task Configuration ##
Tasks can be configured to use a specific Pass Requirements File using the **pass\_requirements\_file** keyword in the [Task Configuration File](CreatingTasks#Task_Configuration_File.md).

## File Location ##
All provided Pass Requirements Files are located here:
```

<vtr>/vtr_flow/parse/pass_requirements
```

Of course, the user may create his/her own as well.

## File Format ##
Each line of the file indicates a single metric, data type and allowable values in the following format:

```

<metric_name>;<type>;<min_value>;<max_value>
```

The **range** type can be used for numerical values, and specifies the permissible range, normalized to the golden result.  Any other data type specified, such as **string**, will require an exact match to pass.

In order for a 'Pass' to be reported, **all** requirements must be met.  For this reason, all of the specified metrics must be included in the parse results (See [Parse Configuration Files](ParseFiles.md)).
